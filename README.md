# fireSafe
This project is a result of developers not being cautious about memory during memory related operations.
Aims to enforce the memory safety during development and safely move run-time bugs to compile-time bugs.

As a perk, this project also has few tools to make the development more easier, ofcourse with memory safety in mind.

The project timeline also includes factoring in the size, performance, time and maintainabilty.
But as of now, we are sticking with memory-saftey (one step at a time).
